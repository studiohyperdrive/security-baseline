# SHD SECURITY BASELINE

At Studio Hyperdrive we often work in smaller teams on decoupled interfaces or microservices. While each of us individually strives to deliver a clean, robust and high-quality end result, we all have our own quirks, interests and expertise.

This document attempts to form a solid set of rules and guidelines to ensure a consistent level of security in our APIs and applications. As with all things in SHD, we will continue working together to make sure each and everyone of us agrees with and complies to these guidelines.
